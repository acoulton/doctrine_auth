An extension of The [Kohana 3 Auth module](http://github.com/kohana/auth) for use
with Doctrine User models.

This module is just a Doctrine port of [Sprig Auth](http://github.com/banks/sprig-auth)
driver by @[banks](http://github.com/banks) who in turn based his sprig-auth from
Kohana's [ORM auth driver](http://github.com/kohana/auth).
