An extension of The [Kohana 3 Auth module](http://github.com/kohana/auth) for use
with Doctrine User models.

This module began with a Doctrine port of [Sprig Auth](http://github.com/banks/sprig-auth)
driver by @[banks](http://github.com/banks) who in turn based his sprig-auth from
Kohana's [ORM auth driver](http://github.com/kohana/auth).

However, it now includes a basic controller, views and logic for managing user registration, login and logout etc. It also supports CFS extension of Doctrine user models.

It is still experimental and should not be used in production without careful checking and review.
